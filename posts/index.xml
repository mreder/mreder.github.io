      <description>Hello and welcome. Today I want to talk to you about the ancient form of journaling. Since I can not go even a single day on the internet without everybody telling me to start one (even though I have one), I thought it was a good time to start speaking about it.
Journal To start this off, I want to ask one very simple questions: What is a journal? And I want to encourage you to take a minute or two and think about it.</description>
