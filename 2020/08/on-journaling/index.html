<p>Hello and welcome. Today I want to talk to you about the ancient form of journaling. Since I can not go even a single day on the internet without everybody telling me to start one (even though I have one), I thought it was a good time to start speaking about it.</p>
<h2 id="journal">Journal<a class="anchor" href="#journal">#</a></h2>
<p>To start this off, I want to ask one very simple questions: What is a journal? And I want to encourage you to take a minute or two and think about it. What things are you imagining as of right now?</p>
<p>Is it a black, leather-bound, minimalistic looking book following a rather specific system framework that dictates how you have to use your journal? Yes, it can be.</p>
<p>Is it a stack of papers in a variety of different colours and sizes, without an underlying system? Yes, it can be.</p>
<p>Or is a journal something in between, something deeply personal and made perfect through it&rsquo;s imperfectness? Because that is my answer to that question.</p>
<p>What I want to say is this: Social media has having a journal made a trend, something that everybody has to have. And if your journal doesn&rsquo;t look as clean and pure as of those posting theirs on the internet, you should feel bad. Atleast that&rsquo;s what I take from seeing this type of posts online.</p>
<p>The thing is that these people out there posting their art journals or perfect lined bullet journals to the internet take hours each day to prepare their journals to look &ldquo;perfect&rdquo;. One might even argue that those people are missing the point of journaling: Writing down and thinking deeply about personal matters.</p>
<p>Takling to yourself in written form and figuring out your inner works with nothing but one&rsquo;s own mind? In that lies the beauty of journaling for me.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal<a class="anchor" href="#personal">#</a></h2>
<p>I have been journaling since I was around 14 years old, so that makes it almost 8 years now. Sometimes I write daily, sometimes I write once a month, but in any case, I keep around a notebook in which I can write and sort out my thoughts. I even use it to help me sleep better, as I will talk about in another blog post.</p>
<p>Now, when I started journaling, I wanted to know everything: What types of paper there are, what types of systems I could use, how keeping a journal could make me successful.</p>
<p>But keeping a journal didn&rsquo;t make me successful or more organized or happier, keeping a journal helped me figure out some mental blockades I built up that would have been very hard to solve without external help. Keeping a journal made me notice when I was treating people wrong, or when something I worked on or spent my time on didn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
<p>You might ask what notebook I am using? Right now, it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;official&rdquo; Bullet Journal Leuchtturm1917, before that it was a grey Confidant notebook from Baron Fig (which will be my next one, too).</p>
<p>Did something change when I switched journals? Yes, externally, the all-black, leather-bound outside looks badass, but else? No, not at all. Neither am I more productive, nor does my journal look any better on the inside, nor did my system change.</p>
<p>You might also ask what &ldquo;journaling system&rdquo; I am using? I am using my kind of bullet journaling, which is essentially the same, but lazier. (to an extreme degree) The first day of a month, I write down the name of the month. Then, starting at the top of the page, going to the bottom of it, I write down the date and a shortform of each weekday in one cell each. This list gets filled with events, deadlines and some other stuff.</p>
<p>After that is done, I start my month. Each day, I can write down a maximum of three to-do&rsquo;s, although in very high-stress situations at university or at work, these turn very vague since I know what I have to do and laziness keeps me from writing it down entirely.</p>
<p>After the items I have to do, I make a small dash on the left side and start writing long-form journal entries on whatever comes to mind, sometimes up to three pages, other times stopping midway of the third sentence and leaving it.</p>
<p>I know this all sounds more than lazy, but that is the system that has established itself after journaling for so long. But understand one thing: this is not the final system. A journal, to me, is more than just a few pieces of paper. Journals are living organisms that change forms multiple times throughout their lifes. We, as people, are not the same. We are not clockwork. Out mood can change day by day, and with our mood, our personality changes. A good journal has got to do the same.</p>
<p>Some months, I include a habit tracker, some months I make a budget list. I think since this journal is so deeply rooted with my personality, I have to stay creative and let everything happen.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t look good, but it does good. I&rsquo;d never post a page out of my journal, but I post the result on the regular. It does not matter if the results I post are blog entries or progress on some projects at work. I post this to my own little space, where it resides. And that is what counts.</p>
<h2 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions<a class="anchor" href="#misconceptions">#</a></h2>
<p>In this section, I want to talk about some journaling misconceptions I encountered over the last few years. Some are that of my own, some of the friends or found on the internet.</p>
<p>The first and obvious one is the feeling of having to keep up. All around the internet, people will tell you that every successful CEO, actor and the influential person keeps a journal, in which they write regularly. And while yes, this might be true, it doesn&rsquo;t paint the whole picture. People don&rsquo;t get successful through the miracle of journaling, they get successful with a mixture of hard work, sweat and an extreme amount of luck. That&rsquo;s the secret.</p>
<p>What journaling does is offer a piece of self-reflection that nobody else can offer you, by tapping into your sub - conciseness and writing what you feel. And that&rsquo;s that. You can use that information or you can choose to ignore it, but writing things down makes them a fact. A fact you deal with. Thus, journaling is a form of meditation.</p>
<p>The second one is something that I mostly see on Instagram. The looks of it. And I often feel guilty too. I&rsquo;d see all these extremely beautiful journals and start to think that my journal is not &ldquo;as good as theirs&rdquo;. In reality, what matters is what you write about, what you do with your journal, not how it looks.</p>
<p>And yes, I do see that some people like to spend a rather large amount of time on their journals, making them look great and all, but that&rsquo;s not something for me. Whenever I tried to do this, I got distracted both while reading and while writing. And if you think about it, that is absolutely the worst thing that can happen to you while journaling, getting distracted while writing into it. That does not mean that you should not make your journal look pretty under any circumstance. Please, use it how you feel fit.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where I have to remember one thing: I am not a failure simply because my journal doesn&rsquo;t look as good as the journal of another person does.</p>
<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words<a class="anchor" href="#closing-words">#</a></h2>
<p>Thank you for making it this far. I hope you enjoyed the content I put out for you today. This is the first post in the &ldquo;ON:&rdquo; series, where I take the approach of writing about things I have experience with and offering solutions against the mainstream.</p>
<p>I want to end this post by asking you two questions: 1.) Are you keeping a journal? If yes, how are you using it to your advantage?</p>
<p>2.) What are some journaling misconceptions you have encountered in your time journaling?</p>
<p>Have a nice day,</p>
<p>Markus</p>
